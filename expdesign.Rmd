## Replication!

## Replication

- Replication is key: we need several samples.

- How many? As much as you can! See [Gelman & Carlin 2014](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691614551642).

- Traditionally, ecology studies have had too low sample sizes. 

- Hence missing many subtle effects, and [prone to bias](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/584.summary).

- Complex models (w/ many predictors, interactions etc) require **high** sample sizes.


## Sample size is very important

## Randomization

![](images/olivar-half.png)


## Randomization

- Haphazard $\neq$ Random

- Stratify: randomize within groups (e.g. species, soil types)



## Have controls

- Untreated individuals, plots... (assigned randomly, of course).

- Must differ only in treatment (i.e. homogeneous environment).

- Measure before & after treatment.

- Consider blind designs to avoid observer bias.
