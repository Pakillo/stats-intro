# Experimental design principles

# Replication

## Replication!

## Replication

- Replication is key: we need several samples.

- How many? As much as you can! See [Gelman & Carlin 2014](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691614551642).

- Traditionally, ecology studies have had too low sample sizes. 

- Low sample sizes miss subtle effects, but also [prone to bias](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6325/584.summary).


## Low sample sizes very sensitive to random noise

## Sample size is very important

See [*The evolution of correlations*](http://vimeo.com/57127001)

## Sample size estimation

- Plan model **before** data collection.

- Do simulations. Power/Sample size analyses ([e.g.](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12504)).

- Plan to have at least **10-30 observations per predictor**.

- Complex models (w/ many predictors, interactions etc) require **high** sample sizes.


# Randomization

## Randomization

![](images/olivar-half.png)


## Randomization

- Haphazard $\neq$ Random

- Stratify: randomize within groups (e.g. species, soil types)


# Controls

## Have controls

- Untreated individuals, plots... (assigned randomly, of course).

- Must differ only in treatment (i.e. homogeneous environment).

- Measure before & after treatment.

- Consider blind designs to avoid observer bias.

1. Replication

2. Randomization

3. Controls
